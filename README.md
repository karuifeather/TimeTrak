# TimeTrak: Employee Time and Attendance Management System

This repository contains the culmination of a collaborative Software Engineering I (CS310 at JSU) project by Aashaya Aryal (me), Jakob Skipper, William Hicks, Caleb Watts, James Highfield, Kevin Navarrete. TimeTrak is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline employee time tracking, payroll calculations, and essential data management. ***Note:** I forked the team repo to update the readme for the "archived" project and pin it under my profile for easy recruiter access. Otherwise, it is just a clone with no further modifications.*

## **System Design and Functionality**

**Overview**

TimeTrak is a thoughtfully designed software application that manages a multifaceted workflow. Its core components include:

* **Employee Data Management:** Secure storage of employee information (name, identification, job title, pay rate structures).
* **Time Tracking:** Precise recording of clock-in and clock-out timestamps for each employee shift.
* **Attendance Reporting:**  Generation of detailed attendance reports, pinpointing any discrepancies or missed entries.
* **Payroll Calculation:**  Automatic and accurate calculation of employee compensation, taking into account regular hours, overtime, shift differentials, and other relevant factors.

**System Architecture**

TimeTrak leverages a MySQL database for secure and organized data storage. The program's logic layer processes this data to generate attendance reports and execute payroll calculations.

**Key Features**

* Intuitive user interface for effortless employee time tracking.
* Automated payroll calculations to reduce manual workload and errors.
* Robust error-handling mechanisms to guarantee data consistency.
* Comprehensive attendance reporting features for thorough workforce management.
